# Swift-Cards

Welcome to **Swift-Cards** â€“ a tool designed to create flashcards using AI. Swift-Cards simplifies the process of turning your notes into easily digestible flashcards. While we are still working on integrating all features and services, we aim to provide a streamlined experience for note management and learning.

[Live Demo](https://swift-cards.vercel.app/)

## Features

- **AI-Generated Flashcards**: Create flashcards using AI to make your notes easier to study and review.
- **Account Management and Authentication**: Utilize Clerk for secure account management and authentication.
- **Mock Payment Plans**: Implemented Stripe for creating mock payment plans to learn more about the Stripe API. Currently, all payment plans are mockups.

## Important Notice

We're currently using Firebase's test version for authentication and data management. This setup might not be usable in the future unless we receive sufficient interest and support from users. If you find Swift-Cards useful, please let us know!

## Future Plans

- **RAG Integration**: We are working on integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The implementation is in progress, and we aim to have it functional soon.
- **Flashcards and API Integration**: We plan to resolve issues with flashcard generation and API calls. There was a conflict with the system prompt, which we suspect might be an internal issue. We will address this based on user feedback.
