## Key Features

- **AI-Generated Flashcards**: Easily create flashcards from your notes using AI. Swift-Cards simplifies complex information into concise, digestible flashcards to streamline studying.

## Important Notice

Swift-Cards is currently utilizing Firebase's test environment for authentication and data management. If there's enough interest and support from users, we may scale the platform and enhance its functionality in the future. Please share your feedback with us!

## Future Plans

- **RAG Integration**: We're working on integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the relevance of flashcard content based on user queries. The integration is in progress, and we hope to release it soon.
- **API and Flashcard Generation Improvements**: We are addressing issues with flashcard generation and API conflicts, particularly with the system prompt. Your feedback will help us improve these features.
